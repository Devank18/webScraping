We believe in two fundamental tenets:

·      Give farmers ownership of a larger part of the food value chainCurrently, most small farmers are trapped in an economic environment in which they are small producers in commodity markets. As a result, they have unstable and low incomes. By giving them greater ownership of the value chain we can greatly stabilize and increase their incomes.
