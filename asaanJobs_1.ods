Educational counselling is an art. It involves understanding the student's background and 

current situation to identify his learning needs. Students who require online practice package

3. Explain about online preparation, its pros and cons

4. Counsel parents and help with the payment process

People should have worked in a company which does outbound sales (take a product, call 

potential leads and sell, worked on some CRM too. Eg: Shaadi.com, Naukri.com, Bharat 

Matrimony, Housing.com, MagicBricks.com, Sulekha,com, Maxboopa.com and similar 

companies)

5. Target oriented

People should have worked where they had targets. They should have at least met targets or

Misconceptions:

1. People who have done sales through inbound offline enquiries in some educational 

institute is not specifically tele-sales. Please don't send candidates with this experience.

Shift timing 8:00 to 3:00 & 3:00 to 10:00
